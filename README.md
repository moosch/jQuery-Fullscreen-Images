jQuery-Fullscreen-Images
========================

A nifty little bit of jQuery and JavaScript to view images in full screen mode.

The first example (index.html) is a simple 'click and view' for single images.
The second example (gallery.html) is a little more complicated. It uses a function to detect which image in a list you are viewing in fullscreen and allows you to use the left and right arrow keys to cycle through them.

You can see the tutorial for this here on my blog here http://www.moosch.co.uk/coding/jquery-full-screen-images/

Hopefully you will find it useful.

Thanks :)
